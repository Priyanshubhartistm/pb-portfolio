## Recommendations by Clients

### [Roy Feldman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/royhax/)
I've had the privilege to work with Aditya on several highly technical cybersecurity R&D projects involving design and implementation of defensive network components in Golang, network protocol research and analysis. He is a bright young engineer, extremely talented in hacking and cybersecurity, with a natural curiosity and passion for hacking, and a gift understanding how systems work, how to design and break them. I am certain that he will succeed in any endeavor he puts his mind to, in the realms of cybersecurity, engineering and beyond! :)

### [Tom Granot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomgranot/)
It's not often that you get to talk to a person who is not only hungry for mentorship, but comes out of the gate with the attitude that enables him to learn so, so quickly on his feet.

Aditya did research for highly technical content for me and independently navigated difficult situations without a lot of guidance. If you're looking for someone to research a technical topic for your content work, Aditya is disciplined, thorough and insistent on understanding things in depth before giving a final output.

Keep on keeping on brother!

## Writings & Blogs

I host my thoughts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@adityapatil24680) rather than building a custom site. Instead of overengineering and reinventing the wheel, I prefer leveraging a mature platform that lets me focus on what matters: sharing insights on AI systems, product strategy, and technical architecture.

## Thing About Me

Beyond engineering and build systems, I find balance in the tactile and the thoughtful. Whether it's exploring the nuances of complex architectures or spending time in the real world, my approach to life is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how things work at their core.

I believe that the best products are built by people who have a diverse range of interests. It's the unique combination of technical depth and human perspective that allows us to create technology that actually resonates.
